In Winter 2020, I co-taught Introduction to Computer Science (COMP 250) with Giulia Alberini. There is no external website for the class but the course materials were quite similar to the [Fall 2017 version of the class](http://www.cim.mcgill.ca/~langer/250-2017.html), designed and taught by Professor Michael Langer. 

I regularly act as head TA for [COMP 251 - Algorithms & Data Structures](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~jeromew/comp251.html) (Fall 2020, Fall 2019, Fall 2018) and  [COMP 250](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~jeromew/comp251.html) (Winter 2018).

I have also TAed COMP 202 - Introduction to Programming, COMP 364 - Computer Tools for Life Sciences, as well as [COMP 564 - Advanced Computational Biology Methods and Research](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~jeromew/comp564.html).
