I am currently teaching at Université du Québec à Montréal, most recently [BIF7100 - Ressources bioinformatiques et bioinformatique séquentielle](https://etudier.uqam.ca/cours?sigle=BIF7100) in Fall 2023 (en français).

Previously, I taught at McGill University:

In Fall 2021, I co-taught Algorithms & Data Structures (COMP 251) with Prof. Jérôme Waldispühl. All the information, course outline, and slides can be found on the [course website](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~jeromew/comp251.html).

In Winter 2020, I co-taught Introduction to Computer Science (COMP 250) with Giulia Alberini. There is no external website for the class but the course materials were quite similar to the [Fall 2017 version of the class](http://www.cim.mcgill.ca/~langer/250-2017.html), designed and taught by Professor Michael Langer.
