I am currently a lecturer at Université du Québec à Montréal, teaching [BIF7100 - Algorithms & Data Structures](https://etudier.uqam.ca/cours?sigle=BIF7100) in Fall 2023.

In Fall 2021, I co-taught Algorithms & Data Structures (COMP 251) with Prof. Jérôme Waldispühl. All the information, course outline, and slides can be found on the [course website](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~jeromew/comp251.html).

In Winter 2020, I co-taught Introduction to Computer Science (COMP 250) with Giulia Alberini. There is no external website for the class but the course materials were quite similar to the [Fall 2017 version of the class](http://www.cim.mcgill.ca/~langer/250-2017.html), designed and taught by Professor Michael Langer. 

I regularly acted as head TA for [COMP 251 - Algorithms & Data Structures](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~jeromew/comp251.html) (Winter 2021, Fall 2020, Fall 2019, Fall 2018) and  [COMP 250](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~jeromew/comp251.html) (Winter 2018).

I have also occasionally TAed COMP 202 - Foundations of Programming, COMP 364 - Computer Tools for Life Sciences, as well as [COMP 564 - Advanced Computational Biology Methods and Research](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~jeromew/comp564.html).
