	I am a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at McGill University. I work in <a href="http://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~jeromew/" target="_blank">J&eacute;r&ocirc;me Waldisp&uuml;hl's</a> group for Computational Structural Biology. <br><br> 

My research focuses on algorithmic and statistical aproaches to modelling and predicting RNA 3D structure, with a focus on the prediction of specific substructures named RNA 3D modules.
I am also interested in human computing and citizen science: my main project as of Winter 2020 focuses on developing a crowd-computing game for large scale analysis of RNA sequence data.
