	I am a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at McGill University. I work under the supervision of <a href="http://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~jeromew/" target="_blank">J&eacute;r&ocirc;me Waldisp&uuml;hl</a>, in the group for Computational Structural Biology at McGill, and <a href="http://cbe.uqam.ca/" target="_blank">Vladimir Reinharz</a>, at UQAM's Computational Biology and Evolution lab. <br><br> 

My main research interests are RNA computational biology and citizen science games.

My RNA research focuses on algorithmic and statistical aproaches to modelling and predicting RNA 3D structure, with a focus on the prediction of specific substructures named RNA 3D modules. I will be presenting [my most recent work](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/834762v2) as a poster at [the 2020 RNA meeting](https://www2.rnasociety.org/conferences/rna-2020/), and as an invited talk at the [24th conference on research in computational molecular biology (RECOMB 2020)](https://www.recomb2020.org/).

My citizen science work focuses on developing a crowd-computing game for large-scale analysis of RNA sequence data. This game has been implemented in [**Borderlands Science**](https://borderlands.com/en-US/news/2020-04-07-borderlands-science/). In this mini-game within **Borderlands 3**, you can receive loot for playing a puzzle game. This game, for which I design the puzzles, contributes to improve our understanding of gut bacteria through sequence alignments. [More on our website](https://dnapuzzles.org/).

When time (and progress!) allows for it, I write [blog posts](https://dnapuzzles.org/category/blog/) to update players on the scientific advances of the project they contribute to by playing the game:
