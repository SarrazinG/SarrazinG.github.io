I am a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at McGill University. I work under the supervision of <a href="http://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~jeromew/" target="_blank">J&eacute;r&ocirc;me Waldisp&uuml;hl</a>, in the group for Computational Structural Biology at McGill, and <a href="http://cbe.uqam.ca/" target="_blank">Vladimir Reinharz</a>, at UQAM's Computational Biology and Evolution lab. I hold a B.Sc in Computer Science and Biology as well as a MSc in Computer Science, both at McGill University. <br><br> 

<p>My main research interests are RNA computational biology and citizen science games.</p>
<p>My RNA research focuses on algorithmic and statistical aproaches to modelling and predicting RNA 3D structure, with a focus on the prediction of specific substructures named RNA 3D modules. I will be presenting <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/834762v2">my most recent work</a> as a poster at <a href="https://www2.rnasociety.org/conferences/rna-2020/">the 2020 RNA meeting</a>, and in a selected talk at the <a href="https://www.recomb2020.org/">24th conference on research in computational molecular biology (RECOMB 2020)</a>.</p>
<p>My citizen science work focuses on developing a crowd-computing game for large-scale analysis of RNA sequence data. This game has been implemented in <a href="https://borderlands.com/en-US/news/2020-04-07-borderlands-science/"><strong>Borderlands Science</strong></a>. In this mini-game within <strong>Borderlands 3</strong>, you can receive loot for playing a puzzle game. This game, for which I design the puzzles, collects the solutions provided by the players to improve our understanding of gut bacteria through genomic sequence alignments. <a href="https://dnapuzzles.org/">More on our website</a>.</p>
<p>When time (and progress!) allows for it, I write <a href="https://dnapuzzles.org/category/blog/">blog posts</a> to update players on the scientific advances of the project they contribute to by playing the game:</p>

<li><a href="https://dnapuzzles.org/2020/04/29/borderlands-science-update-a-peek-at-the-data/">A peek at the data</a></li>
</ul>

<p>I am also President of the McGill Students' Chess Club for the 2020-2021 academic year. We are holding online events and weekly meetings. If you are interested in playing chess, whatever your level, <a href="https://dnapuzzles.org/2020/04/29/borderlands-science-update-a-peek-at-the-data/">find us on facebook!</a>. </p>
